  ## Description

  This application is an e-commerce backend that utilizes mySQL as a database and Javascript as a programming language. This repository includes seeded data that can be used to populate a mySQL database to simulate inventory. From Insomnia, users can make edits to their data base using get, post, put, and delete requests.

  
  ## Installation
  ```
  From the command line:
  - navigate to the relevant directory
  - run "npm i" to install all dependancies from packages.json 
  - run "node seeds/index.js" to seed the database
  - run "node index.js" to begin the application
  - set up a mySQL environment to add the "ecommerce_db" schema
  ```

  ## Usage

  This application can be used to create the backend of an e-commerce site without needing an front-end
